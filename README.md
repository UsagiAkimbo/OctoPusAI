# OctoPusAI: Advanced Machine Learning Platform

## Overview
OctoPusAI is a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to streamline the process of model training, evaluation, and deployment across various domains. This platform encompasses a wide range of functionalities, from data preprocessing and model definitions to API endpoints for external interactions and utility functions for enhanced efficiency and debugging.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Streamlined data loading and preprocessing for various datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, IMDB, and more.
- **Model Definitions and Training**: Support for diverse model architectures including CNN, LSTM, GRU, and custom deep learning models.
- **API Endpoints**: Facilitate model training, evaluation, and interaction with external systems.
- **Task Management**: Efficient task scheduling and management for model training and data processing.
- **MLflow Integration**: Seamless model logging and tracking with MLflow for experiment tracking.
- **Utility Functions**: Comprehensive utility functions including database operations and MLflow utilities.
- **Communication Bus**: A central communication system for inter-module messaging and task management.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OctoPusAI.git
cd OctoPusAI
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Starting the FastAPI Server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
This command starts the FastAPI server, making the API endpoints accessible for model training and evaluation.

### Training a Model
Use the `/train-model` endpoint to train a model on a specified dataset:
```python
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/train-model', json={'dataset_name': 'mnist', 'model_type': 'CNN'})
print(response.json())
```

### Evaluating a Model
Utilize the `/evaluate-model` endpoint to evaluate the performance of a trained model:
```python
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/evaluate-model?model_type=CNN&dataset_name=mnist')
print(response.json())
```
